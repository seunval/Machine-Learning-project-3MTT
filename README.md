# Supervised-Learning-project-3MTT

A hands on practical class organised by 3MTT program in Machine Learning, tutored by AI Academy.

The project is about training a machine learning model using regression analysis to predict house prices.
Feature engineering and different algorithms were used to fine tune the model in order to reduce the error margin.
The libraries used include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.
XGBoost algorithm came out with the least error margin.
